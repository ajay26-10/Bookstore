                <p>William Wordsworth was one of the founders of English Romanticism and one its most central figures
                    and important intellects. He is remembered as a poet of spiritual and epistemological speculation, a
                    poet concerned with the human relationship to nature and a fierce advocate of using the vocabulary
                    and speech patterns of common people in poetry. The son of John and Ann Cookson Wordsworth, William
                    Wordworth was born on April 7, 1770 in Cockermouth, Cumberland, located in the Lake District of
                    England: an area that would become closely associated with Wordsworth for over two centuries after
                    his death. He began writing poetry as a young boy in grammar school, and before graduating from
                    college he went on a walking tour of Europe, which deepened his love for nature and his sympathy for
                    the common man: both major themes in his poetry. Wordsworth is best known for Lyrical Ballads,
                    co-written with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and The Prelude, a Romantic epic poem chronicling the
                    “growth of a poet’s mind.</p>

                <p>Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle KStJ, DL (22 May 1859 – 7 July 1930) was a British writer and
                    physician. He created the character Sherlock Holmes in 1887 for A Study in Scarlet, the first of
                    four novels and fifty-six short stories about Holmes and Dr. Watson. The Sherlock Holmes stories are
                    milestones in the field of crime fiction. Doyle was a prolific writer; other than Holmes stories,
                    his works include fantasy and science fiction stories about Professor Challenger, and humorous
                    stories about the Napoleonic soldier Brigadier Gerard, as well as plays, romances, poetry,
                    non-fiction, and historical novels. One of Doyle's early short stories, "J. Habakuk Jephson's
                    Statement" (1884), helped to popularise the mystery of the Mary Celeste.</p>
